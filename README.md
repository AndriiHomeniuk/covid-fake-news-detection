# covid-fake-news-detection

Main idea is create a simple logistic regression model to classify COVID news to either true or fake.
The process is surprisingly simple and easy. Clean and pre-process the text data, perform feature extraction using NLTK library, build and deploy a logistic regression classifier using Scikit-Learn library, and evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy at the end.
